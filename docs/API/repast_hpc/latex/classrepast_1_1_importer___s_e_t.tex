\subsection{Detailed Description}
Importer that maintains a set of agents being sent from each sending process. 

Note that because this is a set, an agent may appear in it only once, no matter how many times it is requested. Canceling the agent will remove it from the set, even if the agent was requested multiple duplicate times. If the set for a given process is size zero, no mpi 'receive' will be created; if the set has any elements, an mpi 'receive' will be created.

Given an agent request (including requests for agents on multiple other processes), makes a record of the agents that are being requested by this process and will therefore be received from other processes. 

The record must at a minimum indicate which other processes are sending agent information, but may include other information, such as how many times a particular agent has been requested.
